    <p><strong>ONE PIECE</strong>is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Eiichiro Oda. It follows the
        adventures of Monkey D. Luffy and his
        crew, the Straw Hat Pirates, as he explores the Grand Line in search of the mythical treasure known as the "One
        Piece"
        to become the next King of the Pirates.</p>
    <p>Now you all be thinking of who is Luffy?Let me teel you about him-
        Monkey D. Luffy, commonly known as "Straw Hat Luffy" or simply "Straw Hat",is the founder and captain of the
        increasingly infamous and powerful Straw Hat Pirates.He pursues the legendary treasure of the late Gol D. Roger
        in order to become the new Pirate King and reach a further, untold dream (currently known to only his crew,
        family
        and closest friends).He believes that being the Pirate King means having the most freedom in the world.

        Born on Dawn Island, Luffy is the son of Revolutionary leader Monkey D. Dragon and grandson of the Marine hero
        Monkey D. Garp and as such is a member of the Clan of D. Most of his childhood was shaped by Garp and Curly
        Dadan,under whose care he befriended and swore brotherhood to the late Portgas D. "Fire Fist" Ace and Sabo.
        However, he draws his greatest inspiration from the pirate "Red-Haired" Shanks, who (unwittingly) enabled him to
        eat the
        Devil Fruit that turned his body into rubber,sacrificed an arm to save his life, and gifted his signature straw
        hat
        as a symbol of their vow to reunite someday, after Luffy became a great pirate.

        As a pirate, Luffy has actively opposed countless regional, national, and global powers, beginning with several
        established East Blue pirates and extending to the Marines, the Seven Warlords of the Sea, Cipher Pol, the World
        Nobles,
        and even the Four Emperors of the New World. Despite his young age and relatively short career, he has triumphed
        over a
        majority of these, successfully invading and indirectly causing the annihilation of Enies Lobby, escaping the
        impregnable Impel Down, enabling several key developments in the Summit War of Marineford, and defeating three
        Warlords
        and an Emperor in direct combat. At the same time, he carries a great penchant for attracting friends and
        allies; in
        addition to personally engaging every member of his crew, he has earned regard and gratitude among many nations,
        fellow
        pirates, the Revolutionary Army, and even several Marines.

        Luffy has gained wide infamy through his accomplishments, heritage, and general recklessness, drawing many large
        bounties as well as the focused hostility of the World Government, Marine Headquarters, and
        Fleet Admiral Sakazuki in particular.Currently, he is recognized as a central member of the Worst Generation,
        the unwilling leader of the seven-crew Straw Hat Grand Fleet, and—in wake of defeating Kaidou during the Raid on
        Onigashima—one of the Four Emperors, with a bounty of 3,000,000,000. Since the awakening of the Gomu Gomu no Mi
        after
        centuries, Luffy has also been heralded by a few as the second coming of Joy Boy, as well as the next Sun God
        Nika.
